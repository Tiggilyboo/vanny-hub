/*
	This file is automatically adjusted by CMake

	Its purpose is to configure each liblightmodbus header file,
	so the user does not have to pass tons of compiler options each time
	he/she wants to compile the library.
	It also serves as a pretty nice source of information about current
	library setup.

	Do not edit this file manually unless you know what you are doing.
